# Jim's dotfiles

## Vim

I try to keep my .vimrc as light as possible; however, I do use two
plugins that I deem essential: vim-fugitive and lightline. In addition
to this, I use the dracula pro colorscheme. You can alter/remove these
lines if you do not use these.

## Bash

I switch back and forth between Mac OS and Linux, so my .bashrc
sources .bash_profile. The .bash_profile has the majority of settings.
The prompt is custom and includes git information out of the box
without having to install any additional plugins.

## Python

My .pylintrc extends the line length to 100 and whitelists cx-Oracle.
Other than that, it uses the default settings.

## Newsboat

This is really just for me personally. This stores my urls and cache so that I can run newsboat from more than one machine and keep it in sync.
